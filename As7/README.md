How to run my application
1. Make sure you have the Assignment7 folder containing the A7 folder and the sqljdbc_12.4 folder.
2. Open up the A7 folder
3. I created this program on VSCode Mac.. make sure Referenced Libraries contain mssql-jdbc012.4.2.jre11.jar. If not, add it so the JDBC works
4. Make sure you are connected to the SFU VPN before running the program
5. The DatabaseConenction.java contains my username and passphrase. You can either use mine or replace it with your own username and passphrase
6. The main application is on Main.java. Run the program there.
7. This is a terminal-based game. Hope you enjoy :)

8. PS. jar file is called A7.jar
